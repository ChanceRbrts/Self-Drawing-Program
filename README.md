# Self Drawing Program

This is a program that will eventually take an image, break it down into lines, and draw those lines. As of right now, I think this will use OpenGL with SDL.

## Setup
Make sure you have both OpenGL and SDL. (TODO: Make instructions to get GL and SDL.)

Run make to compile the program.
Run `./drawing (image) (displayscale) (imagescale)`, where `displayscale` is the scale of the window relative to the original size of the image and `imagescale` is the size of the image relative to the original size of the image.

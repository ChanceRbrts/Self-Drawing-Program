# Self Drawing Program

This is a program that will eventually take an image, break it down into lines, and draw those lines. As of right now, I think this will use OpenGL with SDL.

## Setup
Make sure you have both OpenGL and SDL. (TODO: Make instructions to get GL and SDL.)

Run make to compile the program.
Run `./drawing $(IMAGELOCATION)`, replacing `$(IMAGELOCATION)` with the location of the image.
